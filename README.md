# paris-playback-tool
PARIS Player & Exporter

A simple Python GUI tool to play back and export audio from .paris files (Morse code timing files).
This companion app works with .paris files generated by the Morse .paris Generator
.

🎧 Features

Open .paris files (CSV-style Morse timing data).

Adjustable playback parameters:

Tone frequency (Hz)

Sample rate (Hz)

Volume (0.0–1.0)

Ramp time (ms) — smooth fade-in/out to remove key clicks

Play directly using system audio tools:

Windows → winsound

macOS → afplay

Linux → aplay or paplay

Export as WAV (always supported)

Export as MP3 (optional, requires pydub + ffmpeg)

Clean, minimal GUI with built-in log output

⚙️ Requirements

Python 3.7 or newer

Tkinter (standard with most Python distributions)

Optional for MP3 export:

pip install pydub


You’ll also need ffmpeg in your PATH:

Windows: Download from ffmpeg.org

macOS: brew install ffmpeg

Linux: sudo apt install ffmpeg

🚀 Usage

Run the tool

python paris_player_exporter.py


Open a .paris file
Click “Open .paris…” and select your timing file (generated by the Morse .paris Generator).

Adjust playback parameters:

Tone frequency: Typical CW tones are 600–800 Hz

Sample rate: Default 44100 Hz

Volume: 0.0–1.0 range

Ramp (ms): Small fade (e.g., 5 ms) avoids clicks

Click “Play” to hear the Morse playback.
You can Stop at any time.

Export WAV / MP3

“Export WAV” → Always available (standard library)

“Export MP3” → Available if pydub and ffmpeg are installed

🧩 Example Workflow

Generate a .paris file using the Morse .paris Generator:

python morse_paris_tool.py


Save output as:

PARIS.paris


Open PARIS.paris in this player:

python paris_player_exporter.py


Adjust tone to 700 Hz, volume 0.6, and ramp 5 ms.

Preview the Morse tone and export it as:

PARIS.wav


or

PARIS.mp3

📖 File Format Reference (.paris)

Example:

# Word: PARIS
# Character speed: 15 WPM
# Farnsworth spacing: 5 WPM effective timing
duration_ms,value
84,1
84,0
252,1
...


Columns:

duration_ms: Duration of ON or OFF segment (milliseconds)

value:

1 → key down (tone ON)

0 → key up (silence)

💡 Use Cases

Generate and audition Morse timing patterns

Test keyer or Farnsworth timing accuracy

Export clean CW tones for training or analysis

Convert .paris data into audio formats for playback or sharing

🧱 Architecture Notes

Synthesizes waveform from timing data into PCM16 (mono).

Uses cosine ramp envelopes for smooth transitions.

WAV export via standard wave module.

Optional MP3 export through pydub if available.
